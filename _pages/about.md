Hi, there!

I am a 5-th year student at Washington University in St (WashU). Louis. 
My research interests include medical image analysis, deep learning and machine learning. 
Since April 2019, I have been a visiting scholar at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), 
where I was co-advised by Dr. [Mark Anastasio](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/people/maa) Computational Imaging Science Laboratory from 
and [Dr. Hua Li](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/people/huali19) from Medical Imaging and Bioinformatics Lab.

Before joining WashU, I obtained my master's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 
advised by Prof. Xiangming Wen. I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic Science and Technology from Wuhan University of Technology.
