Hi, there!

I am a 5-th year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Washington University in St (WashU). Louis. 
Since April 2019, I have been a visiting scholar at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I am co-advised by Dr. Mark Anastasio and Dr. Hua Li. 
I feel very fortunate to work with them both. 
Before joined WashU, I received my M.Eng degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 
and my B.E. degree in Electronic Science and Technology from Wuhan University of Technology.
