Hi, there!

I am a 5-th year PhD student from [Department of Computer Science&Engineering](https://cse.wustl.edu) at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU). 
My research interests include medical image analysis, deep learning and machine learning. 
Since April 2019, I have been a visiting scholar at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), 
where I was co-advised by Dr. [Mark Anastasio](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/people/maa) [Computational Imaging Science Laboratory from 
and](https://anastasio.bioengineering.illinois.edu/) [Dr. Hua Li](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/people/huali19) from [Medical Imaging and Bioinformatics Lab](https://huali.bioengineering.illinois.edu).

Before joining WashU, I obtained my master's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn) in April 2015, 
where I was advised by [Prof. Xiangming Wen](http://www.opensource5g.org/people-2/xiangmingwen). I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic Science and Technology at [Wuhan University of Technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn).
