I am currently a senior research scientist at PAII Inc., CA, working on computer vision, 3d geometry, object detection and tracking, and deep learning.

Prior to PAII Inc., I received my Ph.D. in computer science from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://cse.wustl.edu)(WashU) in Dec. 2021. I was a visiting Ph.D. student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) during Apr. 2019 to Dec. 2021, where I was co-advised by Dr. [Mark Anastasio](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/people/maa) that leads the Computational Imaging Science Laboratory and Dr. [Hua Li](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/people/huali19) that laeds the Medical Imaging and Bioinformatics Lab.
In my Ph.D. studies, I have worked on deep learning methods for computer vision tasks, such as object detection, object counting, semantic object segmentation, and image classification, which relate to biomedical image analysis.

Before joining WashU, I obtained my M.E. in Electronics and Communications Engineering at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn) and B.E. in Electronic Science and Technology at [Wuhan University of Technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn) in Mar. 2015 and June 2022, respectively.
